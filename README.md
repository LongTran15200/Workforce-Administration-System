This C++ project represents an early-stage Employee Management System, offering core functionalities such as inserting employee records, displaying details including ID, Name, DOB, Salary, and Address, and searching for specific records by Employee ID. The system employs file handling and menu-driven programming techniques, with potential plans to implement further features for group management and record modification.
